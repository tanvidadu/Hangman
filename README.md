# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which one player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters  within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.The player  guessing suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

We have tried to built a bot which plays the role of the guessing player. The User gives a word and the bot is responsible for guessing the word in minimum number of tries.
